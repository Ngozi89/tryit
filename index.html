                <p>There is no bad whiskey. There are only some whiskeys that aren't as good as others. 
                    You can handle just about anything that comes at you out on the road with a believable grin, common sense and whiskey.
                I always take Scotch whiskey at night as a preventive of toothache. I have never had the toothache; and what is more, I
                never intend to have it.</p>

                <p>There is no such thing as a bad whisky. Some whiskies just happen to be better than others.

                    Not all chemicals are bad. Without chemicals such as hydrogen and oxygen, for example, there would be no way to make
